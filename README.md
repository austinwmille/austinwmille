Hello there, reader! 👋

    🚀 I’m currently juggling a ton of projects (some wrong people claim it’s "too many" 😜).
    💻 You’ll find most of the coding bits housed right here!
    🔧 The majority of commits revolve around my web development endeavors.
    🎨 For more creative work, check out austinmiller.net.
    💌 Feel free to reach out for literally any reason—or even no reason at all!

A Quick Note

As of November 16, 2024, I’m morally obligated to share that a good chunk of the content here was co-authored by ChatGPT. (Because sharing credit is important!)
