### Hello there, reader 

- I am currently working on a ton of projects (some wrong people say 'too many' ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
- The coding parts are kept here, mostly
- The majority of the use of these repos are for web development projects
- Check out my other work @ austinmiller.net/projects
- Feel free to get in touch
