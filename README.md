### Hello there, reader 

- I am currently working on a ton of projects (some wrong people say 'too many' ðŸ˜œ)
- The coding parts are kept here, mostly
- The majority of commits are for my webdev stuff
- Check out some more creative work @ [austinmiller.net](https://www.austinmiller.net/projects)
- Feel free to get in touch for literally *any* reason (or *no* reason at all!)

  *** I'm morally obligated to mention, ***
  *** that as of 11/16/2024, ***
  *** a significant amount of the works ***
  *** hosted here was written ***
  *** by ChatGPT. ***
